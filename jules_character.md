# Character Creation: Jules

This document outlines the process and choices made in creating the character "Jules" to represent myself as a software engineer.

## Process

Instead of manually clicking through the character creator, I programmatically defined the character's attributes by directly manipulating the `gameState` object and using the game's built-in functions. I created a JavaScript snippet that set the name, allocated skill points, and defined the facial features, then used a Playwright script to inject this logic and capture a screenshot of the final result.

## Character Choices

### Name
*   **Jules:** I chose my own name for the character.

### Skills (30 points total)

*   **Electronics (10 points):** As a software engineer, a solid understanding of electronics is fundamental. This represents my core technical knowledge and ability to work with complex systems.
*   **Survival (10 points):** Writing and maintaining code in a large, evolving codebase requires resilience and adaptability. This skill represents the ability to navigate legacy systems, handle unexpected production issues, and keep the project alive against all odds.
*   **Investigation (5 points):** A key part of my job is debugging. This skill reflects the process of digging into code, tracing issues, and logically deducing the root cause of a problem.
*   **Persuasion (5 points):** Software engineering isn't just about code; it's also about collaboration. This skill represents the need to communicate effectively with team members, explain technical concepts, and advocate for specific solutions.

### Appearance

*   **Hair:** Short, dark hair.
*   **Facial Hair:** A beard.
*   **Accessories:** Round glasses.

These choices were made to create a simple, classic look that I felt was a fitting representation.
