### UI/UX (User Interface/User Experience) Improvements

1.  **Tooltips and Descriptions:** The stats and skills are currently just labels. It would be incredibly helpful to add tooltips that appear when a user hovers over a stat (like "Strength") or a skill (like "Electronics"). These tooltips should explain what the stat/skill does in the game. For example, hovering over "Constitution" might show: *"Determ-ines your character's toughness, hit points, and resistance to poison and disease."*
2.  **Tabbed Interface:** The character creator is one long scrolling panel. To make it less overwhelming and easier to navigate, you could separate it into tabs, such as:
    *   **Main** (Name, Stats)
    *   **Skills**
    *   **Appearance** (Face Creator)
3.  **Live Derived Stats:** When a player allocates points to stats like "Strength" or "Constitution," they don't see the immediate impact. It would be great to have a small section that shows "Derived Stats" like Hit Points, Carry Weight, Action Points, etc., and updates in real-time as the player adjusts their core stats. This makes their choices feel more impactful right away.
4.  **Skill Point Counter:** The skill point counter is visible, but it could be made more prominent. Also, consider showing the cost of increasing a skill if you plan to have scaling costs in the future (e.g., the first point costs 1, the next costs 2, etc.).

### Gameplay & Depth Suggestions

1.  **Character Archetypes/Templates:** For players who might be overwhelmed by choice, offering a few pre-built archetypes could be a great starting point. For example:
    *   **Technician:** Starts with high Intelligence and points in Electronics and Investigation.
    *   **Brawler:** Starts with high Strength and points in Unarmed and Melee Weapons.
    *   **Survivor:** Starts with high Constitution and points in Survival and Medicine.
    A player could select one and then customize it further.
2.  **Backgrounds or Origins:** Adding a "Background" selection could add a lot of role-playing flavor and replayability. A background could provide a small, unique bonus or a starting item. For example:
    *   **"Ex-Mechanic":** Starts with a bonus to actions involving machinery.
    *   **"Wasteland Wanderer":** Starts with a higher resistance to hunger/thirst.
    *   **"Former Guard":** Starts with a piece of basic armor.
3.  **Appearance Affecting Dialogue (A Minor Touch):** This is a more advanced suggestion, but you could add small, subtle dialogue changes based on a character's appearance. An NPC might comment on a character's "liberty spikes" hairstyle or their "monocle," which can make the world feel more reactive.
